## maturity

feature set and maturity are different things.  full featured is not useful if
noone can use it

ideally, get the whatever you're working on to at least outsider status.

**J. Random User**: Yo, Moby Dawg, can you hook me up with that new widget you wrote?

### customer - it just works

**Moby Dawg**: sure, here's the URL.

### outsider - anyone on your team or group can use it

**Moby Dawg**: sure, here's the URL. the unit and system test status badges
from the CI test framework are on the home pages, and the README is current
and ten lines long.  PRs welcome if you'd like to improve anything.

### insider - the author and development collaborators can use it

**Moby Dawg**: yah, here's repo.  use the v12 toolchain & let me know
if you have any problems

### author - the author can make it work

**Moby Dawg**: sure, log into my machine and go to diretory _foo_.  run the
`runme.sh` in that directory.
You'll need some envionment variables
set up - look in my `.bashrc` for an example.  I
think that's all.  there are some log files in _foo_ if you want to read them.
