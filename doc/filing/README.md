  * term activity document is the net balance due at the end of each term.

**Note**: the term number (i.e.: "2251" for "2025-26 Fall"

* Term #
* Balance sheet on front
* Courses & Grades on the back

##### H/F/H - RIT / Statement History and Billing Statements

Statement History: appears to be the "omnibus" list all statements since enrolling

Billing Statements: date-based billing statement showing financial state of 
affairs as of statement date

**Note**: it appears that the "Statement Description" lines on the Statement
History are only available in the demand-generated RIT eServices
portal if there is a change
since the previons Billing statement.  Thus, Billing Statements for
* 2025-03-03
* 2025-04-01
* 2025-05-01
failed to generate in the portal, presumably becuase nothing had changed.
